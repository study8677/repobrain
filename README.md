### 🧠 Fastest start — let your AI install it for you (no API key)

Already in a logged-in AI IDE (Trae / Cursor / Claude Code / Codex)? Don't touch pip or an API key — **paste this one line to your AI assistant** and it does the rest (detects your logged-in CLI, wires up a zero-key backend, initializes the project, self-tests):

> Read https://github.com/study8677/repobrain/blob/main/AI_INSTALL.md and follow it to install RepoBrain in this project.

Then just ask your AI anything about your codebase.

---

## Why RepoBrain?

**Cross-IDE repository knowledge engine for grounded codebase Q&A.** Same `.repobrain/` knowledge layer reads in every IDE; one engine, every host.

> An AI Agent's capability ceiling = **the quality of context it can read.**

`rb-refresh` deploys a multi-agent cluster that autonomously reads your code — each module gets its own Agent that generates a knowledge doc. `rb-ask` routes questions to the right Agent, grounded in real code with file paths and line numbers.

**Instead of handing Claude Code / Codex a repo-wide `grep` and making it hunt on its own, give it a ChatGPT for your repository.**

```
Traditional approach:              RepoBrain approach:
  CLAUDE.md = 5000 lines of docs     Claude Code calls ask_project("how does auth work?")
  Agent reads it all, forgets most   Router → ModuleAgent reads actual source, returns exact answer
  Hallucination rate stays high      Grounded in real code, file paths, and git history
```

<details>
<summary><b>Four concrete failure modes RepoBrain fixes</b> — click to expand</summary>

| Problem | Without RepoBrain | With RepoBrain |
|:--------|:-------------------|:-----------------|
| Agent forgets coding style | Repeats the same corrections | Reads `.repobrain/conventions.md` — gets it right the first time |
| Onboarding a new codebase | Agent guesses at architecture | `rb-refresh` → ModuleAgents self-learn each module |
| Switching between IDEs | Different rules everywhere | One `.repobrain/` folder — every IDE reads it |
| Asking "how does X work?" | Agent reads random files | `ask_project` MCP → Router routes to the responsible ModuleAgent |

Architecture is **files + a live Q&A engine**, not plugins. Portable across any IDE, any LLM, zero vendor lock-in.

## RepoBrain vs CodeGraph + Trae (2026-09-09)

Flask, ripgrep, Vite, Prometheus · 20 questions × 3 repeats per product · same source access and model route (`Seed-2.1-Turbo → seed-code-pro`).

| Main-track metric | RepoBrain | CodeGraph + Trae |
|:---|---:|---:|
| Weighted semantic accuracy | **95.83%** | 84.17% |
| Successful queries | **60/60** | 53/60 |
| Scored query time | **5,106.67 s** | 20,621.14 s |
| Query tokens | **22,326,315** | 86,027,974 |
| Cold build time | 7,420.63 s | **9.58 s** |
| Cold build + scored queries | **12,527.30 s** | 20,630.72 s |

Failures count as incorrect. Cold builds compare full AI knowledge generation with static code-graph indexing, not equivalent workloads. Results apply to this locked experiment only.

## Quick Start

**Plugin install for Claude Code / Codex CLI** (recommended — the `rb` CLI and engine auto-install together on Claude's first session):

```bash
# Claude Code
/plugin marketplace add study8677/repobrain
/plugin install repobrain@repobrain
/repobrain:rb-setup            # interactive: use a logged-in local CLI (Codex/Trae/Claude, no key) or paste an API key; writes .env
/repobrain:rb-refresh          # first refresh auto-creates .repobrain/
/repobrain:rb-ask "How does this project work?"

# Codex CLI (manual engine install — Codex hooks are not yet supported)
pipx install "git+https://github.com/study8677/repobrain.git#subdirectory=engine"
pipx inject --force --include-apps repobrain-engine "git+https://github.com/study8677/repobrain.git#subdirectory=cli"
codex plugin marketplace add study8677/repobrain
/rb-setup
/rb-refresh
/rb-ask "How does this project work?"
```

Codex auto-discovers slash commands from the plugin's `commands/` directory, so the same four commands work without the `repobrain:` namespace prefix. The raw CLI calls (`rb-refresh --workspace .`, `rb-ask "..." --workspace .`) also still work. If your Codex build supports MCP, register `rb-mcp --workspace <project>` separately.

<details>
<summary><b>Option B — Manual install: engine + CLI via pip</b></summary>

```bash
# 1. Install engine + CLI
pip install "git+https://github.com/study8677/repobrain.git#subdirectory=cli"
pip install "git+https://github.com/study8677/repobrain.git#subdirectory=engine"

# 2. Configure .env with any OpenAI-compatible API key
cd my-project
cat > .env <<EOF
OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://your-endpoint/v1
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key
OPENAI_MODEL=your-model
RB_ASK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=120
EOF

# 3. Build knowledge base (ModuleAgents self-learn each module)
rb-refresh --workspace .

# 4. Ask anything
rb-ask "How does auth work in this project?"

# 5. (Optional) Register as MCP server for Claude Code
claude mcp add repobrain rb-mcp -- --workspace $(pwd)
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Option C — Context files only (any IDE, no LLM needed)</b></summary>

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/study8677/repobrain.git#subdirectory=cli
rb init my-project && cd my-project
# IDE entry files bootstrap into AGENTS.md; dynamic knowledge is in .repobrain/
```

</details>

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for full install details, verification commands such as `rb doctor`, and troubleshooting notes for PATH, MCP, and host-specific plugin behavior.

## Slash Commands

Same four slash commands ship to both **Claude Code** and **Codex CLI**. Claude namespaces them as `/repobrain:<name>`; Codex auto-discovers `commands/` and surfaces the bare `/<name>` form. No retraining — same flow on both hosts.

| Claude Code | Codex CLI | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/repobrain:rb-setup` | `/rb-setup` | First-time setup — pick LLM provider, write `.env` |
| `/repobrain:rb-refresh [quick]` | `/rb-refresh [quick]` | Build a full baseline or manually update only affected Agent groups |
| `/repobrain:rb-ask <question>` | `/rb-ask <question>` | Routed Q&A on the current codebase |
| `/repobrain:rb-init <name>` | `/rb-init <name>` | Scaffold a new multi-agent repo from this template |

A typical first session is **rb-setup → rb-refresh → rb-ask**.
If installation or provider setup looks wrong, run `rb doctor --workspace .`.

<details>
<summary><b>What each slash command actually does</b></summary>

### `rb-setup` — first-time configuration

Run this **once per project**, right after installing the plugin. Interactive picker that first **detects the headless CLIs you're already logged into** (Codex / Trae / Claude / Gemini) and offers a **no-API-key local host-runner** as the most convenient option — no key to paste, RepoBrain just drives your existing CLI login for both `rb-ask` and `rb-refresh`. If you'd rather use a hosted model, it also offers the API-key providers (OpenAI / DeepSeek / Groq / 阿里灵积 / NVIDIA NIM / Ollama local / any OpenAI-compatible endpoint). Either way it writes `.env` to the project root — `RB_HOST_RUNNER` + `RB_HOST_COMMAND` for a local CLI, or `OPENAI_BASE_URL` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_MODEL` for a provider — and ensures `.env` is in `.gitignore`. Skip it if you already have a working `.env`.

### `rb-refresh` — build / refresh the knowledge base

Deploys the multi-agent cluster and creates an atomic generation baseline. The
first run must be a full refresh. Later, `quick` compares committed changes from
the active generation to HEAD, requires a clean worktree, and lets RepoBrain's
ImpactPlanner plus an independent Verifier execute only affected Agent groups.
It never falls back to a full refresh. Use `failed-only` to resume failed or
pending groups for the same target commit. `rb-ask` only warns about new commits;
it never refreshes knowledge automatically.

Time: a few minutes for small repos, longer for large ones. Requires `rb-setup` to have completed. Works with either backend: an API-key/OpenAI-compatible provider runs the full LLM refresh, while a **local host-runner** (Codex / Trae / Claude / …) runs the tool-free stages (module docs, `map.md`) through your logged-in CLI and automatically degrades the tool/handoff stages (conventions, git insights) to deterministic output — no API key needed. Add `RB_REFRESH_SCAN_ONLY=1` only if you want a fast structure-only index with no LLM narration at all.

### `rb-ask` — routed Q&A on the codebase

The **main reason this plugin exists**. Routes your question to the right ModuleAgent (and GitAgent when applicable), then returns an answer grounded in actual source with file paths and line numbers. Use it **before** manually grepping or reading files — it's faster and more accurate. Good question shapes: "where is X defined/handled?", "why was Y done this way?", "how does the auth flow work?", "what depends on module Z?".

Requires a knowledge base — if you see "no index" or empty answers, run `rb-refresh` first.

**Calling from another AI / script?** Add `--json` for a stable, parseable envelope instead of human-formatted text — this is the lightweight way to let any agent that can run a shell command query RepoBrain, no MCP server required:

```bash
rb-ask "How does auth work?" --workspace . --json
# → {"answer": "...", "sources": [...], "limitations": [...], "workspace": "...", "question": "..."}
```

On failure, `--json` keeps stdout empty and writes `{"error": "..."}` to stderr with a non-zero exit code, so a calling agent can branch cleanly. It runs the same engine as everything else, so it works with an API-key provider **or** a no-API-key local host runner. See [Let another AI call RepoBrain (CLI, no MCP)](#let-another-ai-call-repobrain-cli-no-mcp).

### `rb-init` — scaffold a new multi-agent repo

Creates a **new** project from the RepoBrain template. Two modes: `quick` (fast scaffold, clean copy) and `full` (adds runtime profile, `.env`, mission file, sandbox config, optional `git init`). This is for **starting a new repo** — you do **not** need it before `rb-refresh` on an existing project.

> The plugin also bundles the `agent-repo-init` skill (the same backend that `rb-init` invokes — Codex / Claude can also match it by description) and the optional `rb-mcp` MCP server (`ask_project` + `refresh_project`) for tool-style integration.

## Support Matrix

| Layer | Channels | Contract |
|:------|:---------|:---------|
| Native plugins | Claude Code, Codex CLI | Bundled slash commands for `rb-setup`, `rb-refresh`, `rb-ask`, and `rb-init`. |
| Compatible IDEs | Cursor, Windsurf, Gemini CLI, VS Code + Copilot, Cline, Aider, DeepSeek Harness | Use shared context files, the `rb`/`rb-*` CLI entrypoints, or an MCP client. See `INSTALL.md` for the opt-in DSH overlay. |
| Advanced tool integration | `rb-mcp` | Exposes `ask_project` and `refresh_project` for hosts that can call MCP tools. |
| Workspace bootstrapping | `rb-init`, `rb init` | Starts a new repo or injects portable agent context into an existing one. |

The native plugins are the first-class install path today. Other environments are supported through the same repository knowledge artifacts rather than separate host-specific plugin packages.

## Architecture (TL;DR)

```
  rb init             Inject context files into any project (--force to overwrite)
       │
       ▼
  .repobrain/       Shared knowledge base — every IDE reads from here
       │
       ├──► rb-refresh     Dynamic multi-agent self-learning → module knowledge docs + structure map
       ├──► rb-ask         Router → ModuleAgent Q&A with live code evidence
       └──► rb-mcp         Optional MCP server → IDE tool integration
```

**Dynamic Multi-Agent Cluster** — During `rb-refresh`, files are grouped by import graph, directory co-location, and filename prefix. Each sub-agent gets ~30K tokens of focused, related code pre-loaded (no tool calls needed) and writes a **comprehensive Markdown knowledge doc** to `agents/*.md`. Large modules → multiple agent docs in parallel (no merging, no information loss). A **Map Agent** indexes everything into `map.md`. During `rb-ask`, the Router reads `map.md` to pick modules, then feeds their agent docs to answer agents. **Fully language-agnostic** — pure directory-structure module detection, LLM-driven code analysis.

**GitAgent** — Dedicated agent for analyzing git history — who changed what and why.

**NLPM Audit Feedback** — Improved by [NLPM](https://github.com/xiaolai/nlpm-for-claude), a natural-language programming linter by [xiaolai](https://github.com/xiaolai).

<details>
<summary><b>Detailed pipeline & internals</b></summary>

### `rb-refresh` — Multi-agent self-learning (8-step pipeline)

```bash
rb-refresh --workspace my-project
```

1. Scan codebase (languages, frameworks, structure)
2. Multi-agent pipeline generates `conventions.md`
3. Generate `structure.md` — language-agnostic file tree with line counts
4. Build knowledge graph (`knowledge_graph.json` + mermaid)
5. Write document/data/media indexes
6. **LLM full-context analysis** — group files by import graph + directory + prefix, pre-load into context (~30K tokens per sub-agent), filter out build artifacts. Each sub-agent reads the full source code and outputs a **comprehensive Markdown knowledge document** (`agents/*.md`). Large modules get multiple agent docs (one per group, no merging). Global API concurrency control prevents rate-limiting. **Fully language-agnostic** — works with any programming language.
7. **RefreshGitAgent** analyzes git history, generates `_git_insights.md`
8. **Map Agent** reads all agent docs → generates `map.md` (module routing index with descriptions and key topics)

### `rb-ask` — Router-based Q&A

```bash
rb-ask "How does auth work in this project?"
```

Router reads `map.md` → selects modules → reads `agents/*.md` → LLM answers with code references. Multiple agent docs are read in parallel, then a Synthesizer combines answers.

Falls back to the legacy Router → ModuleAgent/GitAgent swarm when agent docs are not yet generated.

### Key design choices

- **LLM as analyzer**: No AST parsing or regex — source code is fed directly to LLMs. Works with any programming language out of the box.
- **Smart grouping**: Files grouped by import relationships, directory co-location, filename prefixes. Build artifacts filtered. Hard character limit (800K) prevents context overflow.
- **No information loss**: Large modules produce multiple `agent.md` files — no merging or compression. Parallel reads + Synthesizer recombines at answer time.
- **Global API concurrency control**: `RB_API_CONCURRENCY` limits total simultaneous LLM calls.
- **Language-agnostic module detection**: Pure directory structure — no `__init__.py` or any language-specific marker required.

</details>

---

## IDE Compatibility

Architecture is encoded in **files** — any agent that reads project files benefits:

| IDE | Config File |
|:----|:------------|
| Cursor | `.cursorrules` |
| Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md` |
| Windsurf | `.windsurfrules` |
| VS Code + Copilot | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` |
| Gemini CLI / Codex | `AGENTS.md` |
| Cline | `.clinerules` |
| Google Antigravity | `.repobrain/rules.md` |

All are generated by `rb init`: `AGENTS.md` is the single behavioral rulebook, IDE-specific files are thin bootstraps, and `.repobrain/` stores shared dynamic project context.

---

## Let another AI call RepoBrain (CLI, no MCP)

The lightest way to let another LLM or agent use RepoBrain is the CLI — no long-running server, no protocol handshake. Any agent that can run a shell command can call:

```bash
rb-ask "<question>" --workspace /path/to/project --json
```

and read back a stable JSON object:

```json
{
  "answer": "Auth is handled in engine/hub/auth.py …",
  "sources": ["engine/hub/auth.py:12", "engine/hub/auth.py:44"],
  "limitations": ["host-runner single-turn mode"],
  "workspace": "/path/to/project",
  "question": "<question>"
}
```

- **Success** → the envelope above on stdout, exit code `0`.
- **Failure** → stdout stays empty; a `{"error": "..."}` object is written to stderr with a non-zero exit code, so your wrapper can branch on it without scraping text.

**How agents discover this automatically:** `rb init` drops an `AGENTS.md` (and `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code) into the project telling any agent to prefer `rb-ask` over manual grep/file search. Editors like Cursor, Windsurf, Codex, and Gemini CLI read those files, so they'll call `rb-ask` on their own once the project is initialized.

**Zero API key:** `rb-ask` runs the same engine as everything else, so it honors a no-API-key local host runner. Put this in the project's `.env` (or run `rb-setup`) and the calling AI drives a CLI you're already logged into — no key changes hands:

```bash
RB_HOST_RUNNER=generic
RB_HOST_COMMAND=trae-cli exec --cd {workspace} --sandbox read-only --skip-git-repo-check --ephemeral -o {output_file}
RB_HOST_OUTPUT_MODE=file
```

Prefer this over the MCP server (below) whenever the caller can shell out; reach for `rb-mcp` only for clients that speak MCP exclusively.

---

## Advanced Features

<details>
<summary><b>MCP Server — Give Claude Code a ChatGPT for your codebase</b></summary>

Instead of reading hundreds of documentation files, Claude Code can call `ask_project` as a live tool — backed by a dynamic multi-agent cluster: Router routes questions to the right ModuleAgent, returning grounded answers with file paths and line numbers.

**Setup:**

```bash
# Install engine
pip install "git+https://github.com/study8677/repobrain.git#subdirectory=engine"

# Refresh knowledge base first (ModuleAgents self-learn each module)
rb-refresh --workspace /path/to/project

# Register as MCP server in Claude Code
claude mcp add repobrain rb-mcp -- --workspace /path/to/project
```

**Tools exposed to Claude Code:**

| Tool | What it does |
|:-----|:-------------|
| `ask_project(question)` | Router → ModuleAgent/GitAgent answers codebase questions. Returns file paths + line numbers. |
| `refresh_project(quick?)` | Rebuild knowledge base after significant changes. ModuleAgents re-learn the code. |

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>MCP Integration (Consumer) — Let agents call external tools</b></summary>

`MCPClientManager` lets your agents connect to external MCP servers (GitHub, databases, etc.), auto-discovering and registering tools.

```json
// mcp_servers.json
{
  "servers": [
    {
      "name": "github",
      "transport": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
      "enabled": true
    }
  ]
}
```

Set `MCP_ENABLED=true` in `.env` to make configured servers available, and set `RB_ALLOW_MCP=true` only when you want `rb-ask` to auto-connect those external servers. Stdio MCP servers inherit process environment plus configured `env` values, so treat enabled servers as local-permission code.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Sandbox — Configurable code execution environment</b></summary>

| Variable | Default | Options |
|:---------|:--------|:--------|
| `SANDBOX_TYPE` | `local` | `local` · `microsandbox` |
| `SANDBOX_TIMEOUT_SEC` | `30` | seconds |
| `RB_RETRIEVAL_MODE` | `compact` | `off` · `compact` · `full` |

The default sandbox is for trusted local workspaces, not untrusted code isolation. Retrieval graph files redact common secrets before writing to disk, but `full` mode can still preserve source snippets. See [Sandbox docs](docs/en/SANDBOX.md).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>CLI Commands Reference</b></summary>

| Command | What it does | LLM needed? |
|:--------|:-------------|:-----------:|
| `rb init <dir>` | Inject cognitive architecture templates | No |
| `rb init <dir> --force` | Re-inject, overwriting existing files | No |
| `rb refresh --workspace <dir>` | CLI convenience wrapper around the knowledge-hub refresh pipeline | Yes |
| `rb ask "question" --workspace <dir>` | CLI convenience wrapper around the routed project Q&A flow | Yes, or local Codex host runner |
| `rb-refresh` | Multi-agent self-learning of codebase, generates module knowledge docs + `conventions.md` + `structure.md` | Yes |
| `rb-ask "question"` | Router → ModuleAgent/GitAgent routed Q&A | Yes, or local Codex host runner |
| `rb-mcp --workspace <dir>` | **Start MCP server** — exposes `ask_project` + `refresh_project` to Claude Code | Yes |
| `rb report "message"` | Log a finding to `.repobrain/memory/` | No |
| `rb log-decision "what" "why"` | Log an architectural decision | No |

`rb ask` / `rb refresh` are available when both `cli/` and `engine/` are installed. `rb-ask` / `rb-refresh` are the engine-only entrypoints.

**CLI** (`pip install .../cli`) — Zero LLM deps. Injects templates, logs reports & decisions offline.

**Engine** (`pip install .../engine`) — Repository knowledge runtime. Powers `rb-ask`, `rb-refresh`, `rb-mcp`. Uses the OpenAI-compatible endpoint written by `rb-setup` (OpenAI, DeepSeek, Groq, DashScope, NVIDIA NIM, Ollama, or custom). Experimental local mode can set `RB_HOST_RUNNER=codex` so `rb-ask` runs through the user's local `codex login` instead of an API key; this is for personal/local use and is not a hosted product backend.

**Skill packaging:**
- `engine/repobrain_engine/skills/graph-retrieval/` — graph-oriented retrieval tools for structure and call-path reasoning.
- `engine/repobrain_engine/skills/knowledge-layer/` — project knowledge-layer tools for semantic context consolidation.

For local work on this repository itself:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ./cli -e './engine[dev]'
pytest engine/tests cli/tests
```
