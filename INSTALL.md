# Installing the RepoBrain plugin

## Claude Code

```
/plugin marketplace add study8677/repobrain
/plugin install repobrain@repobrain
/repobrain:rb-setup
/repobrain:rb-refresh
/repobrain:rb-ask "what does this project do?"
```

1. **Marketplace add** — clones the plugin manifest into Claude Code's cache.
2. **Install** — first session triggers `hooks/install_engine.py`, which installs the engine (`rb-ask`, `rb-refresh`, `rb-mcp`) and injects the `rb` CLI into the same `pipx` environment. It falls back to `pip --user` or prints manual commands if installation fails. Cross-platform (macOS / Linux / Windows).
3. **Setup** — interactive: it **first detects any logged-in local headless CLI** (Codex / Trae / Claude / Gemini) and offers a **no-API-key local host runner** as the easiest default — no key to paste, RepoBrain drives your existing CLI login for both `rb-ask` and `rb-refresh`. If you prefer a hosted model, it also offers API-key providers (OpenAI / DeepSeek / Groq / 阿里灵积 / NVIDIA / Ollama). Either way it writes a `.env` to the current project root and ensures it's git-ignored.
4. **Refresh** — runs `rb-refresh` directly and builds `.repobrain/` for the current project. The first refresh creates the project knowledge directory automatically. With an API key you get the full tool-using / handoff refresh; in local host-runner mode refresh still runs its tool-free stages (module docs, map) through your CLI and automatically degrades tool/handoff stages (conventions → single-turn agent, git insights → deterministic pre-extracted data).
5. **Ask** — runs `rb-ask` directly and queries the refreshed project knowledge base.

MCP is optional. If you want tool-style integration in an MCP-compatible host,
register `rb-mcp --workspace <project>` separately. To let `rb-ask` consume
external MCP servers, set both `MCP_ENABLED=true` and `RB_ALLOW_MCP=true` only
for servers you trust.
An example MCP config lives at `docs/examples/repobrain.mcp.json`.

You can also add the marketplace from a local checkout:

```
/plugin marketplace add /absolute/path/to/repobrain
```

## Codex CLI

Codex CLI does not auto-run install hooks (as of April 2026), so install the engine and inject the CLI first:

```
pipx install /absolute/path/to/repobrain/engine
pipx inject --force --include-apps repobrain-engine /absolute/path/to/repobrain/cli
rb doctor --help     # verify CLI + engine availability
```

Then register and install the plugin:

```
codex plugin marketplace add /absolute/path/to/repobrain
```

Codex auto-discovers slash commands from the plugin's `commands/` directory (no manifest entry required), so the same four commands are available without the `repobrain:` prefix:

```
/rb-setup
/rb-refresh
/rb-ask "what does this project do?"
/rb-init my-new-project
```

For routine refreshes from the project directory, run `rb-refresh` every time.
It automatically builds, resumes a matching interrupted task, incrementally
updates, or skips an already-current base. Use `rb-refresh --full` only for a
new complete rebuild. `--workspace` means the project folder and defaults to the
current directory. Refresh requires clean, committed Git state. Removed refresh
options are rejected; see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the breaking change.

You can also keep using the raw CLI directly: `rb-refresh --workspace <project>` and `rb-ask "question" --workspace <project>`.
If your Codex build supports MCP and you want tool-style integration, register
`rb-mcp --workspace <project>` separately in your Codex MCP configuration.

### Local host-runner mode without an API key

If you are only using RepoBrain locally and have a logged-in headless CLI, you can drive it as
the backend for **both `rb-ask` and `rb-refresh`** — no API key. The easiest path is `rb-setup`,
which detects your CLI and writes this for you; to configure it by hand, pick your runner:

**Codex** (built-in preset):

```
codex login status
cat >> .env <<'EOF'
RB_HOST_RUNNER=codex
# RB_HOST_MODEL is optional. Leave it unset to use the model your codex login
# defaults to; set it only to force a specific model, e.g.:
# RB_HOST_MODEL=gpt-5.3-codex-spark
RB_HOST_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=240
RB_HOST_MAX_CONTEXT_CHARS=60000
EOF
```

**Trae / any headless CLI** (generic runner via `RB_HOST_COMMAND`):

```
trae-cli login status
cat >> .env <<'EOF'
RB_HOST_RUNNER=generic
RB_HOST_COMMAND=trae-cli exec --cd {workspace} --sandbox read-only --skip-git-repo-check --ephemeral -o {output_file}
RB_HOST_OUTPUT_MODE=file
RB_HOST_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=240
EOF
```

The generic runner never picks a model for you (`RB_HOST_MODEL` is ignored). To
pin a model, add the CLI's own model flag directly to `RB_HOST_COMMAND`
(e.g. `trae-cli exec --model <name> ...`).

Then:

```
rb-refresh --workspace .      # builds the knowledge base through your local CLI, no API key
rb-ask "what does this project do?" --workspace .
```

This depends on the user's local CLI installation and login. It is not a hosted product backend.
Because a local CLI is **single-turn and tool-free**, refresh runs module docs and the map
through your CLI and degrades the tool/handoff stages: conventions collapses to a single-turn
agent, and git insights fall back to deterministic pre-extracted data. A configured API backend
always wins and keeps the full tool-using / handoff refresh. Prefer a pure scan (no LLM at all)?
Set `RB_REFRESH_SCAN_ONLY=1`.

## DeepSeek Harness

DeepSeek Harness (`dsh`) is a compatible host, not a native RepoBrain plugin.
It is also not the same thing as choosing DeepSeek as the `rb-setup` LLM
provider. There is no `/plugin marketplace add` path and no Cordis bundle in
this repository.

Install the engine first, the same way Codex users do:

```
pipx install /absolute/path/to/repobrain/engine
pipx inject --force --include-apps repobrain-engine /absolute/path/to/repobrain/cli
rb doctor --help
```

Then pick one of these opt-in paths:

1. **CLI via shell** — in a DSH session whose workspace is the project, run
   `rb-refresh --workspace .` and `rb-ask "what does this project do?" --workspace .`.
   DSH already loads `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`.
2. **MCP overlay** — replace `/path/to/project` in
   [docs/examples/repobrain.dsh.cordis.yml](docs/examples/repobrain.dsh.cordis.yml)
   and launch:

```
dsh web --patch /absolute/path/to/repobrain/docs/examples/repobrain.dsh.cordis.yml
```

You can instead merge that `insert` block into `$DSH_HOME/cordis.patch.yml`.
The overlay starts `rb-mcp` over stdio. Treat it as trusted local code. Default
Claude Code and Codex plugin installs do not auto-start this server.

DSH is in developer preview; the overlay only uses the published
`@deepseek-ai/dsh-mcp-client` fields. If `rb-mcp` is missing from PATH, DSH
typically still boots and the tools stay unavailable until the engine is
installed.

## Verifying

- **General check**: run `rb doctor --workspace <project>` after installation. It should report engine, provider, knowledge freshness, and log locations without exposing the API key.
- **Claude Code**: `/repobrain:rb-ask "what does the engine do?"` should run `rb-ask` and print a routed answer.
- **Codex CLI**: `/rb-ask "what does the engine do?"` (or `rb-ask "..." --workspace <project>` from the shell) should print a routed answer.
- **DeepSeek Harness**: `rb-ask "what does the engine do?" --workspace <project>` from the DSH shell, or `ask_project` after loading the overlay, should print a routed answer.

## Available slash commands

Same four commands ship to both hosts. Claude Code namespaces them as `/repobrain:<name>`; Codex CLI surfaces them as bare `/<name>`.

| Claude Code | Codex CLI | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `/repobrain:rb-setup` | `/rb-setup` | **First-time setup** — interactive `.env` writer (logged-in local CLI = no key, or an API-key provider + model) |
| `/repobrain:rb-refresh [--full]` | `/rb-refresh [--full]` | Automatically build, resume, or update affected Agent groups; --full forces rebuilding |
| `/repobrain:rb-ask <question>` | `/rb-ask <question>` | Routed Q&A on the current codebase |
| `/repobrain:rb-init <name>` | `/rb-init <name>` | Scaffold a new multi-agent repo from this template |

The plugin also bundles the `agent-repo-init` skill (description-matched in either host), which is what `/rb-init` invokes under the hood.

## Optional MCP tools

If you manually register `rb-mcp`, the `repobrain` MCP server exposes:

- `ask_project(question)` — routed Q&A with file paths and line numbers
- `refresh_project(full=False)` — automatically build, resume, update, or skip; `full=True` forces a new complete rebuild

Example configs:

- generic MCP host: [docs/examples/repobrain.mcp.json](docs/examples/repobrain.mcp.json)
- DeepSeek Harness overlay: [docs/examples/repobrain.dsh.cordis.yml](docs/examples/repobrain.dsh.cordis.yml)

## Uninstall

```
pipx uninstall repobrain-engine
/plugin uninstall repobrain
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+ on PATH (`python3` / `python`)
- `pipx` recommended (`brew install pipx`, `apt install pipx`, or `python3 -m pip install --user pipx`)
- Network access on first launch (for the auto-installer)

## Safety Boundaries

- Default local execution is intended for trusted local workspaces, not
  untrusted-code isolation.
- `RB_RETRIEVAL_MODE=compact` is the default. `full` keeps richer retrieval
  artifacts; common secrets are redacted before write, but source snippets can
  still be captured.
- MCP stdio servers inherit process environment plus configured `env` values.
  Treat enabled servers as local-permission code.

## Troubleshooting

**`rb` / `rb-ask` / `rb-refresh` not found after install**
The user-pip bin directory may not be on PATH. The installer prints the path; add it to your shell rc file (`~/.zshrc`, `~/.bashrc`, etc.).

**Optional MCP tool is not connected**
The default slash commands do not require MCP. If you manually enabled `rb-mcp`, restart the MCP host so it reloads server configuration.

**Diagnostic log**
`rb-mcp` writes startup and tool errors to `~/.claude/plugins/data/repobrain-repobrain/rb-mcp.log` unless Claude provides a plugin data directory.

**Do I need `/rb-init` before refresh?**
No. `/rb-refresh` initializes the current project's `.repobrain/` directory automatically. `/rb-init` is for scaffolding a new repository from the RepoBrain template.

**Hook timed out**
The first install allows up to 15 minutes for the engine dependency set. On a slower network, run `pipx install <plugin-root>/engine` followed by `pipx inject --force --include-apps repobrain-engine <plugin-root>/cli` before restarting.

**Codex CLI marketplace add fails or does not auto-load the plugin**
Codex's marketplace/plugin workflow varies by CLI build. If `codex plugin marketplace add <path>` rejects the repo, or if your build only registers the marketplace without installing plugins, register the MCP server directly via your local Codex CLI MCP config and load skills + commands from `<path>/skills/` and `<path>/commands/` manually.

**DeepSeek Harness overlay does not expose tools**
Confirm `rb-mcp` is on PATH, replace `/path/to/project` in the overlay, and
restart `dsh` so it reloads the patch. The overlay is opt-in; DSH does not
discover `.claude-plugin/` or `commands/*.md`. This is not a DeepSeek API key
problem — `rb-setup` choosing DeepSeek as the LLM provider does not configure
the DSH host.
