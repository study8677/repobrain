## 🚀 Phase 9: Enterprise Core (In Progress)

**Goal**: Transform Antigravity from a workspace into an autonomous **Agent Operating System**

The final vision is a production-grade system where enterprises can:
- 🏗️ Build agents declaratively
- 🚀 Deploy at global scale
- 🔒 Execute code safely in sandboxes
- 🧪 Orchestrate complex workflows
- 📊 Monitor and observe at scale
- 💾 Persist state and history

### Phase 9A: Sandbox Environment 🔒
**Objective**: Safe, isolated code execution for high-risk operations

**Proposed Solutions:**
- **E2B Integration**: Deploy to E2B infrastructure for sandboxed Python execution
- **Docker Containerization**: Lightweight per-task containers
- **Resource Limits**: CPU, memory, disk quotas per execution
- **Network Isolation**: Controlled external access
- **Timeout Enforcement**: Automatic task termination

**Example Usage:**
```python
from antigravity_engine.sandbox.factory import get_sandbox

sandbox = get_sandbox()
result = sandbox.execute(
    code="import numpy; print(numpy.__version__)",
    timeout=30,
)
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Run untrusted or risky code safely
- ✅ Parallel task isolation
- ✅ Cost-efficient resource scaling
- ✅ Compliance with security policies

### Phase 9B: Orchestrated Flows 🔀
**Objective**: Complex, structured task pipelines with DAG support

**Proposed Architecture:**
- **DAG Definition**: YAML or JSON task graphs
- **Conditional Execution**: Branch on results
- **Parallel Steps**: Execute independent tasks concurrently
- **Error Handling**: Retry, fallback, and compensation strategies
- **Monitoring**: Real-time execution tracking

**Example DAG:**
```yaml
# workflows/data_pipeline.yaml
name: daily_data_pipeline
steps:
  fetch_data:
    agent: DataCollector
    input: {"source": "api", "date": "today"}
  
  validate_data:
    agent: DataValidator
    depends_on: fetch_data
    input: "{fetch_data.output}"
  
  analyze_trends:
    agent: AnalysisEngine
    depends_on: validate_data
    parallel:
      - sentiment_analysis
      - correlation_analysis
  
  report_generation:
    agent: ReportWriter
    depends_on: [analyze_trends]
    input: "{analyze_trends.output}"
  
  notify_stakeholders:
    agent: NotificationService
    depends_on: report_generation
```

**Benefits:**
- 📊 Model complex business processes

*(Timeline is aspirational and dependent on community adoption)*

## 💡 Enterprise Use Cases

Once Phase 9 is complete:

**Scenario 1: Autonomous Data Pipeline**
```
User: "Build a daily data ingestion that validates, transforms, 
       and reports on customer metrics"

Agent OS:
├─ Fetch raw data (Sandbox: safe scraping)
├─ Validate schema (Sandbox: isolated validation)
├─ Transform (Sandboxed parallel processing)
├─ Generate reports
└─ Alert stakeholders
  
All orchestrated, monitored, and recoverable.
```

**Scenario 2: Multi-Team Coordination**
```
Executive: "Analyze competitor market position and recommend 
           pricing strategy"

Agent OS delegates:
├─ Researcher Agent (gathers market data)
├─ Analyst Agent (statistical analysis)
├─ Strategy Agent (competitive positioning)
└─ Report Agent (synthesis)

Results coordinated, traced, and audited.
```

## 🔮 The Vision

Imagine a world where:
- 🏗️ Complex workflows are specified in YAML
- 🤖 Agents execute them safely, in parallel, across the globe
- 📊 Every action is observable, traceable, and recoverable
- 🎯 Humans focus on strategy; agents handle execution

**That's the Antigravity Agent OS.**
